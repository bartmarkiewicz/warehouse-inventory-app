# warehouse-inventory-app
App I've made for Android(for the purposes of learning) which uses AndroidViewModel to connect a database to an Android  application. You can add items to a recycler view through an SMS or the GUI input forms. 

Also uses a ContentProvider to allow other apps to access the items added to the warehouse.

Made in 2019
